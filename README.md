Random Password Generator

Created by: Aidan Wilett 12/3/2019

This project is a website random password generator

To start: press the “generate Password” button which will begin the pop-ups to creat a password.

You will have a couple choices of what characters you want in the password.

Once you have answered all the prompts, the password will be pasted into the “your secure password” box.

Once it is made, you can press the “copy to clipboard” button to copy the generated password to your clipboard ad a pop-up will display letting you know that is it copied.
